cat genome.txt | tr -d '\n' | grep -o GATTACA | wc -l

What these commands do is it displays genome.txt to stdout, 
uses translate to delete all of the new line characters, making 
the file 1 long string, then grep the string to find where the pattern is found
and use wc -l to count the amount of lines where it is found
