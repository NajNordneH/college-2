My input into the program to get it to print 'You're root!' is

   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

During my first tests with the program and gdb, I first tried to overflow the buffer with A's,
and then adding 'You're root!' to the end of the sequence. However, I found after further
analysis that when overflowing the buffer, you then begin to add to the i local variable in the
program, and once that has gotten to a certain size (in my input, exactly 9 extra 'A's'), it over-
flows into the ok variable, and once that is greater than 0, the program prints 'You're root!'

In fact, the 'lowest', value that could be put at the end of this character string is 32, which is the
decimal value of the ASCII character for ' '
