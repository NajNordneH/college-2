* Inspection of program
From doing some testing with adding strings to the program, it is clear that this is a program which prints the arguments passed to it with no format strings
so just in the form
#+begin_src c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    printf(argv[1]);
}
#+end_src

Also, the return address is kept the same, at least on my prompt, and it is about 8 bytes into the stack

After some more testing with the program, it seems to crash after an input of 106 characters, which I found by putting the output of the program into a file, and then
using the command wc -m to count the amount of characters (-1 for the null byte)
