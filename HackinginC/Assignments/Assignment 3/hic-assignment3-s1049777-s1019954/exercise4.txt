b) The process is forced to quit by the terminal. This is because while the space for both the matrices is
   freed, the space that was allocated for the individual arrays within each matrix was not freed. This leads
   eventually to there not being any more space on the heap, and the program crashes.

c) In order to fix this problem, after allocating the values, I would free the individual arrays, and then free
   the matrices before the loop has finished.
