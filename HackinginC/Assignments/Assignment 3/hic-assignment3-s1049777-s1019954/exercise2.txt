b) The output of my program on my system is always the same, however, I did not expect it to be so, as I am
   checking if the pointer x is null in my for loop. malloc can sometimes fail, so I expected it to sometimes
   change how many bytes were allocated.

c) There was no change to the output of my program between malloc and calloc, however, I would expect that
   there should be, as sometimes the amount of meory that was requested to malloc will overflow, so the
   function will succeed, but there will be much less memory, so I would have expected there, at some point
   to have been a difference in the amount of memory that it could allocate

d) If you do not check for malloc failure, then trying to use the pointer leads to undefined behaviour,
   which will make the program completely useless.
